The Employee table holds all employees including their managers. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the manager Id.

|Id    |Name 	  |Department |ManagerId |
+------+----------+-----------+----------+
|101   |John 	  |A 	      |null      |
|102   |Dan 	  |A 	      |101       |
|103   |James 	  |A 	      |101       |
