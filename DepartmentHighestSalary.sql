The Employee table holds all employees. Every employee has an Id, a salary, and there is also a column for the department Id.

+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| Id | Name  | Salary | DepartmentId |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 1            |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
The Department table holds all departments of the company.

+----+----------+
| Id | Name     |
+----+----------+
| 1  | IT       |
| 2  | Sales    |
+----+----------+
Write a SQL query to find employees who have the highest salary in each of the departments. For the above tables, Max has the highest salary in the IT department and Henry has the highest salary in the Sales department.

+------------+----------+--------+
| Department | Employee | Salary |
+------------+----------+--------+
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |

# my solution, simply max

SELECT d.Name as Department, e.Name as Employee, e.Salary 
from Department d, Employee e
where e.DepartmentId=d.Id 
and e.Salary=(Select max(Salary) from Employee e2 where e2.DepartmentId=dep.Id)

# other solutions 1: subquery in FROM, max

SELECT D.Name AS Department ,E.Name AS Employee ,E.Salary 
FROM
	Employee E,
	(SELECT DepartmentId,max(Salary) as max FROM Employee GROUP BY DepartmentId) T,
	Department D
WHERE E.DepartmentId = T.DepartmentId 
  AND E.Salary = T.max
  AND E.DepartmentId = D.id

# other solutions 2: (tricky) compare to get highest salary

SELECT D.Name,A.Name,A.Salary 
FROM 
	Employee A,
	Department D   
WHERE A.DepartmentId = D.Id 
  AND NOT EXISTS 
  (SELECT 1 FROM Employee B WHERE B.Salary > A.Salary AND A.DepartmentId = B.DepartmentId) 

# other solutions 3: subquery in WHERE

SELECT D.Name AS Department ,E.Name AS Employee ,E.Salary 
from 
	Employee E,
	Department D 
WHERE E.DepartmentId = D.id 
  AND (DepartmentId,Salary) in 
  (SELECT DepartmentId,max(Salary) as max FROM Employee GROUP BY DepartmentId)

# other solution 4: join then group by

SELECT b.Name as Department, a.Name as Employee, a.Salary 
FROM Employee a JOIN Department b ON a.DepartmentId = b.Id 
GROUP BY Department HAVING a.Salary = max(a.Salary)
